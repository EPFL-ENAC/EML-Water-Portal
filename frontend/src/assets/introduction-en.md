## UrbanTwin Portal: Data and Hydrological Model Visualization

This portal, developed as part of the UrbanTwin project funded by the ETH Domain, is open to all users. It provides access to data and models collected and developed through this project. All data are freely available for research, studies, or environmental and urban interest purposes. These data are made available by the ETH Domain, EPFL, the Canton of Vaud, and EPFL’s Environmental Microbiology Laboratory.
All data can be downloaded and used freely, with the condition that the source must always be cited in any publication or report where the data are used.
The portal offers physical and chemical measurements, as well as information on water levels and flow rates of the Sorge River, along with data on certain stormwater and industrial water discharges from the EPFL campus. The Sorge River, located on the Vaud Plateau, originates in the Jura mountains and flows into Lake Geneva through the Chamberonne River. After crossing the EPFL campus, the Sorge meets the Mèbre River and becomes the Chamberonne.
In addition to the aforementioned data, the portal provides rainfall information recorded on the EPFL campus and allows users to simulate different land-use scenarios for the campus.

## Using the Portal

### Interactive Map (left side of the portal)
* Mini Interactive Map: The map shows all installed sensors, the watersheds of the EPFL campus, and the major pipelines discharging into the Sorge River or Lake Geneva. By clicking on the sensor icons, you can view information about them. You can also select which sensors you want to display on the graphs directly from the map.
* Watershed: By clicking on a watershed on the campus, a pop-up window appears. This window allows you to simulate different land-use scenarios, as well as options for rainwater storage and management. These choices affect the hydrological response and runoff volumes shown in the simulations. You can then observe how these scenarios change the amount of water in some of the discharges into the Sorge River.
* Full Screen: The map can be enlarged to full screen by clicking on the corresponding tab.

### Sensors
You can select the sensors of interest from the "Sensors A," "Sensors B," and "Sensors C" sections. By clicking on these sections, a dropdown menu will show all the sensors in each group. You can choose to display or hide certain sensors on the graphs by checking or unchecking the boxes.

### Parameters:
The "Parameters" section allows you to select the types of graphs you want to display on the right side of the portal. The graphs will display the data from the sensors you selected in the "Sensors" section located just below the interactive map. You can enlarge any graph by clicking on the "full screen" icon next to the parameter name.

### Time Range:
In this section, you can select the time range for the data you want to display on the graphs by using the calendar icons. You can also zoom in and out on the graphs to adjust the time range of the data being displayed.

### Scenarios
The scenarios you define via the mini map, based on the selected watershed, will appear in this section.

### Right Side of the Portal
* In the top-right corner of the portal, you can find additional information and resources by clicking on the respective icons.
* A "Charts height" slider allows you to adjust the height of the graphs. You can also choose to display the graphs in one or two columns by clicking on the respective icons.

### Additional Data
Water samples from the river and runoff discharge are also collected as part of this project. These samples are analyzed in laboratories to measure the concentrations of certain metals such as copper (Cu), iron (Fe), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), uranium (U), manganese (Mn), and cobalt (Co). Laboratory results for the metal concentrations in these samples can be requested by email only at the following contact: [danandersson@epfl.ch](mailto:danandersson@epfl.ch).
