## UrbanTwin Portal: Data and Hydrological Model Visualization

This portal, developed within the framework of the UrbanTwin project funded by the ETH Domain, is open to all users. It provides access to the data and models collected and developed within this project. All data is freely accessible for research, study, or for environmental and urban purposes. The data is made available by the ETH Domain, EPFL, the Canton of Vaud, the Environmental Microbiology Laboratory of EPFL, and the University of Lausanne.
All data can be freely downloaded and used, provided that the source is always cited in any publication or report in which the data is used.
The portal offers physical and chemical measurements, as well as information on water levels and flows of the Sorge River, in addition to data on certain stormwater and industrial discharges from the EPFL campus. The Sorge River, located on the Vaud Plateau, originates in the Jura and flows into Lake Geneva via the Chamberonne River. After crossing the EPFL campus, the Sorge joins the Mèbre River and becomes the Chamberonne.
In addition to the mentioned data, the portal provides information on precipitation recorded on the EPFL campus and allows users to simulate different land-use scenarios for the campus.

## Using the Portal

### Interactive Map (on the left side of the portal)

* Mini interactive map: the map displays all installed sensors, the catchment areas of the EPFL campus, as well as the main discharge pipes to the Sorge River or Lake Geneva. By clicking on the sensor icons, you can view information about them. You can also select the sensors to display in the graphs directly from the map.
* Catchment area: by clicking on a catchment area of the campus, a pop-up window appears. This window allows simulation of different land-use scenarios, as well as stormwater storage and management options. These choices influence the hydrological response and runoff volumes shown in the simulations. You can observe how these scenarios change the amount of water in certain discharges to the Sorge River.
* Full screen: the map can be enlarged to full screen by clicking on the corresponding tab.

### Sensors
You can select sensors of interest from the sections “Multi-parameters sensors”, “Multi-parameters sensors (Unil)”, “Temperature sensors” and “Water level and rain sensors”. By clicking on these sections, a drop-down menu displays all sensors in each group. You can choose to show or hide certain sensors on the graphs by checking or unchecking the boxes.

### Measured Parameters
The “Measured Parameters” section allows you to select the types of graphs you want to display on the right-hand side of the portal. The graphs will display data from the sensors you selected in the “Sensors” section, located just below the interactive map. You can enlarge each graph by clicking on the “full screen” icon next to the parameter name.

### Time Range
In this section, you can select the time period of the data to be displayed on the graphs using the calendar icons. Some time ranges are already pre-set above the timeline bar. It is also possible to zoom into an area of interest in a graph using the corresponding icon located at the top right of each graph. At the top right of each graph, there are also buttons to return to the previous zoom as well as a button to display the full time range.

### Modeled Parameters
The parameters modeled according to the scenarios you define via the interactive map will appear in this section. Each modeled parameter can be treated in the same way as the measured parameters.

### Right Side of the Portal
* In the upper right corner of the portal, you will find additional information and resources by clicking on the corresponding icons.
* A “Graph Height” slider allows you to adjust the height of the graphs. You can also choose to display the graphs in one or two columns by clicking on the corresponding icons.
* The download icon allows you to download all the data represented in the different graphs. Therefore, it is necessary to choose the time range, sensors of interest, and parameters of interest before downloading the data.

### Additional Data
Water samples from the river and runoff discharges are also collected as part of this project. These samples are analyzed in the laboratory to measure the concentrations of certain metals such as copper (Cu), iron (Fe), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), uranium (U), manganese (Mn), and cobalt (Co). The analysis results of these metal concentrations can be obtained upon request by email only, at the following address: [dan.andersson@epfl.ch](mailto:dan.andersson@epfl.ch).
